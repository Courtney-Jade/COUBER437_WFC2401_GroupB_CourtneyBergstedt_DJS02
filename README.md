# Simple Division Calculator
This code provides a basic division calculator implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to input two numbers and calculates their division. The code includes error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios like division by zero, missing values, and non-numeric inputs.

## Original Code Structure
The original code consisted of:

1. Declaration of given parameters such as initial velocity, acceleration, time, initial distance, initial fuel, and fuel burn rate.
2. A function calcNewVel was declared after parameter declaration, but it was assigned after being used, causing a reference error.
3. Incorrect calculations were made directly based on the given parameters without considering units or potential errors.
4. Output statements printed the results without considering the need for proper unit conversions or error handling.

## Changes Made:
1. Descriptive variable names were used to enhance code clarity.
2. Proper indentation and formatting were applied for improved readability.
3. Implemented validation checks to ensure that all input parameters are of the correct type (numbers).
4. Robust error handling mechanisms were added to prevent silent failures and provide meaningful error messages.
5. Updated the message for division results to accurately reflect decimal outcomes.
