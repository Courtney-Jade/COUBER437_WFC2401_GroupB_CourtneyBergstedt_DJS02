# Simple Division Calculator
This code provides a basic division calculator implemented in JavaScript. It allows users to input two numbers and calculates their division. The code includes error handling mechanisms to handle various scenarios like division by zero, missing values, and non-numeric inputs.

## Changes Made:
1. Descriptive variable names were used to enhance code clarity.
2. Proper indentation and formatting were applied for improved readability.
3. Implemented validation checks to ensure that all input parameters are of the correct type (numbers).
4. Robust error handling mechanisms were added to prevent silent failures and provide meaningful error messages.
5. Updated the message for division results to accurately reflect decimal outcomes.
